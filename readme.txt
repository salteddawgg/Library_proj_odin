hello this is the library project from the odin project
anyone can use this code if they wish, though its not very well built so do at your own risk
I plan on working on this project over time, and suggestions or cretques are most welcom!
curently only uses basic web dev code (ie, HTML CSS JavaScript)

CURENT FEATURES
1. add the author, title, no. of pages, and if you have read a book or not to a book
2. add many books to your book list (curently no limit but may change when I change storage methode)
3. ability to change the have or have not read status on any book in your list
4. ability to remove a book from your list

Future improvements planned

1. ability to store book list localy so that list is not lost on every page reload
2. ability to add thumbnail to book
3. styleization options


This project has helped me relearn/ just learn javaScript, but i still have a long way to go
I really want to get to learning React as soon as posible.
